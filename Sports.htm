    When I was in highschool I was really big into cross country and track, I did this for all four years I was there. I made it to state three years in cross country (which is a 5k) that was pretty cool and I got 93rd which doesnt sound very good but there were like over 200 people there so I was very happy with that. I could run a mile in under 5 minutes.
